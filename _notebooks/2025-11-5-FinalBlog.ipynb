That led to mixed versions, random breakages, and \"why does it work on your laptop?\" moments.</p>\n",

I'm also more comfortable with GitHub Pages and using issues for communication. The biggest change was learning how a collaborative approach (with a clear scrum master/roles) prevents arguments and keeps us on time. It sounds basic, but it made everything smoother and more respectful.</p>\n",

Seeing a parent and student compare scores while laughing made all the little fixes feel worth it.</p>\n",
    "  <p>CSA students generously walked me through a JSON-first mindset: define a clean schema for quizzes (title, prompt, choices, answer), then bind it to the UI. That flipped my thinking. A tiny backend + structured data = a lighter, more maintainable frontend. We also talked about tradeoffs (nesting depth, validation, and keeping endpoints focused) and keeping motion subtle so it felt alive without distracting.</p>\n",
